DAILY: During the week there are two peaks of bike demand, one in the morning (7-9 am) and one in the afternoon (5-7 pm). On the weekend the bikes are mainly used during the day, with a peak in noon/early afternoon (12am - 4pm). On holidays there is only one peak of bike demand during the day, similar to the weekend distribution. 
MONTHLY: During the year the bike demand in the individual months is slightly different between registered users and casual users. The first use the bikes all year around, mainly from mai till december, the latter use the bikes far less (lower toal number), but mainly from april till october.
YEARLY: There is an inrease in demand visible from 2011 to 2012
